## About

Work for the **Cellz Competition**, GECCO 2004 (I won 1st place), April 2004.

> Cellz is a game framework where you provide a controller for a simple cellular creature (shown in blue) - with the aim of eating as much food as possible (shown in red).
>
> There are many variations of the game.  The specific challenge for GECCO 2004 is to evolve or design a controller implemented as a directed graph.  Your cells will play as the only species in the game, and the aim is to acquire as much total cell mass as possible within 1000 time-steps.
>
> The game begins with 10 randomly placed pieces of food, and five randomly placed cells.  Each cell has a functionally identical controller, but may behave very differently to its neighbours due to three factors: different external inputs, different internal state, and the use of a pseudo-random number generator.
>
> At each point in time your cell controller takes directional inputs from the game area (think of a wrap-around retina) and outputs a force vector, which (together with its current mass (a = f/m)), determines its acceleration for that time step.
>
> You can design a controller by hand, or evolve one.  My guess is that an evolved controller will win - but we'll have to wait and see!
